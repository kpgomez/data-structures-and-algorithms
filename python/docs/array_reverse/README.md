# Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverse_array which takes a list as an argument, and returns a list with the elements in reversed order.

## Whiteboard Process
![whiteboard](/docs/array_reverse/reverse_array%20whiteboard.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: It looped through the list twice which is O(2n) which
reduces to O(n)
Space: O(n) since reverse_list creates new space in memory equal
in size to original input list

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
`pytest -k test_array_reverse.py`
