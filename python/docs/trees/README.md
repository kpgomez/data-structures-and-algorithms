# Challenge Title
Trees implementation

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->

## Approach & Efficiency
The Big O time complexity for all three DFS traversal methods was O(n) because it had to visit each node in the Binary Tree.
The space complexity is O(1) because no matter the size of the tree, the space it takes is constant.

The Big O time complexity for BST's contains and add method is O(log base n). The space complexity is O(1).
