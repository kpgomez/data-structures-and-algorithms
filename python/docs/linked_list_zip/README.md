## Approach & Efficiency
I think the solution involves reassigning pointers for each node but I'm unsure how to capture the exact steps and how to translate that into code. I think Big O for time complexity would be O(n). Space complexity would be also be O(n) because the size of the new linked list would be equal to size of the two inputs.

## Solution

I do not have a solution at this time.
