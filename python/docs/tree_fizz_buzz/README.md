# Fizz Buzz Tree
Traverse a k_ary_tree and create a new tree. For each node, check for fizzbuzz. The new tree will have the same structure
as the original tree with the exception that its node values will be "FizzBuzz" if original node value is divisible by 5 and 3,
"Buzz" if divisible by 5, "Fizz" if divisible by 3, or a string of the original node value if it doesn't meet any of the
fizzbuzz criteria.
